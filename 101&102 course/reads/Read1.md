# 1-What is Markdown?
 Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
 Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.<br>
 Markdown is a simplified version of basic HTML. With Markdown, I can quickly create well-organized documents that look great and can transfer anywhere. What’s more,
 all I need to look at the result is a web browser. Or, if I prefer, I can create a more permanent version of the document as a PDF.
Before we go too deep into why Markdown is so great, I need to first sell the idea that HTML document format is ideal for academic notetaking at all.
Most notes are a form of outline. There exists a hierarchy of information wherein some ideas are subordinate to others, or related to others. Crafting this relational
structure is a significant component of synthesis. As students receive information, they must decide how new concepts relate to those already present in the schemata they
are building in the body of notes and in the students’ body of knowledge. This decision process increases cognitive load and leads to better retention.

# 3-What is GitHub Pages? 

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub
optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see examples of GitHub Pages sites in the GitHub Pages examples collection.
You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain. For more information, see "Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages."
If your project site is published from a private or internal repository owned by an organization using GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you can manage access control for the site.
Organization owners can disable the publication of GitHub Pages sites from the organization's repositories. For more information, see "Managing the publication of GitHub Pages
sites for your organization."
